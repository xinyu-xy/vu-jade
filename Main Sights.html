		  <h1><b>Genius-Scaring Pavilion</b></h1>
		  <p><img src="images/genius-scaring pavilion.jpg" width="600" height="200" /></P>
		  <p>This pavilion stands within the Southern Section, 132 m east of Yellow Crane Tower and 159 m southwest of White Cloud Pavilion. Its name is thought to have been inspired by an anecdote about Li Bai. Cui Hao was Vice Director of the Bureau of Merit Titles in the Ministry of Personnel in Tianbao Period of Tang’s Emperor Xuanzong. Once a time, Cui visited the tower during his return from the frontier and composed the household poem Inscription on Yellow Crane Tower.</p>
		  <p><img src="images/genius-scaring pavilion01.jpg" width="600" height="350" /></p>
		  <p>This poem begins with his exploration of the tower name. In this way, the poet contrasts vast space with fleeting time, reminding readers of inevitable vicissitudes. He envied the past one who had attained immortality and felt depressed about his failed career. Patriotic as he was, he could do nothing to serve the country and thus wanted to discard the secular world. But as his eyes feasted on the nearby view, the poet missed his hometown inevitably. Such contrast blends the wild imagination and the harsh reality with great finesse.</p>
		  </p>It is said that poet-fairy Li Bai ascended the tower and savoured the impressive scenery. As is known to all, this brilliant poet boasted “improvising great poems after cups of wine.” When he saw Cui’s poem, however, the genius felt so scared as not to write anything, “Now a great view comes in sight, but I can write nothing as Cui Hao’s poem depicts that at its best.”</p> 
		  <p>That poem even made the genius Li Bai put aside his writing brush. The news spread like wildfire. As a result, the tower and the poem gained widespread acclaim. The tower was even named Cui’s Tower and Wuhan was called a land of white clouds and yellow crane. Cui Hao has enjoyed prestige in the hall of poetry. Southern Song critic Yan Yu praised him most in Remarks on Poetry from a Wanderer on Azure Waters, “Of all Tang’s eight-syllable octaves, Cui Hao’s poem ranks first indeed.”</p>
          <h1><b>South Tower</b></h1>
		  <p><img src="images/south tower.jpg" width="600" height="350" /></p>
          <p>For this edifice, there are other sobriquets like White Cloud Tower, Tower of Pacifying Distant Regions, Tower of Gorgeous Moon and Tower of Chu’s View. South Tower, Yellow Crane Tower, Monk Temple and North Pavilion are known as “Four Wonders” of ancient Snake Mountain. In 1985, it was rebuilt 185 m southeast of Yellow Crane Tower and 100 m southwest of White Cloud Pavilion.</p>
		  <p>This tower owes its cultural origin to Eastern Jin Epoch. In the 9th Year (334) of Emperor Chengdi’s Xianhe Period, Inspector-General of Jingzhou Prefecture Tao Kan died of illness. So, Yu took his place at Wuchang—General of Western Conquest. According to “Demeanor,” A New Account of Tales of the World, Yu Liang ascended the tower of Wuchang in a night and chatted wildly with his aides. This tale has become a legend in the eyes of later generations as well as a source of tower-specific culture. Nonetheless, the tower he mounted back then is not located on Snake Mountain, Wuchang, but on the Gulou Street in the downtown Ezhou, Hubei.</p>
		  <h1><b>West Gate</b></h1>
		  <p><img src="images/west gate.jpg" width="600" height="350" /></p>
		  <h1><b>Bronze Sculpture The Return of the Yellow Crane</b></h1>
		  <p><img src="images/yellow crane.jpg" width="600" height="250" /></p>
		  <p>The sculpture 50 m west of Yellow Crane Tower consists of turtle, snake and cranes—all auspicious animals. On the rock in front of the steps, turtle and snake move upward, and two elegant cranes ride them as if looking down on the human realm. It features 5.1 m height and 3.8 ton weight.</p>
		  <h1><b>Mume Garden</b></h1>
		  <p><img src="images/Mume Garden.jpg" width="600" height="220" /></p>
		  <p> As the flower of Wuhan, mume has been loved for its bravery and tenacity. Mume blossoms not only add a new attraction to the park, but even give all tourists a fresh getaway to enjoy a floral extravaganza. In each early spring—exactly the 3rd lunar month, all such trees burst into white or red blossoms, diffusing a brisk fragrance for many miles. So, no mume aficionado would miss the great chance.</p>
		  <p>From 1992 onwards, the park has planted a cluster of winter-sweets. Such shrubs love to grow in shady places and bloom in the depth of winter. Each time the flowering period comes, this nook scatters a pristine scent far and near. Those ravishing shrubs of the northern slope almost become a must-see wintersight.</p>
